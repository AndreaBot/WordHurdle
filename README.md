WordHurdle is a Wordle clone, the massively popular word game were the user has six attempts at guessing a five-letters word.
After getting absolutely hooked to the original game it was only natural for me to have a go at recreating this game using Swift.

Just like Tic-Tac-Toe, this was another weekend challenge I gave to myself, it ended up taking a few extra days but I thoroughly enjoyed building this one.
This was my second-to-last app I built in UIKit before diving deep into SwiftUI.

Features:

- Custom keyboard to help the user keeping track of what letters have already been used
- Re-created the color-based feedback: green for correct letter in the correct space, yellow for correct letter in wrong place and grey for when the letter does not appear in the secret word
- Toolbar buttons to navigate through the boxes and clear all letters in the active row
- Smooth animations to display feedback after each guess
- End-of-round messages to celebrate a victory or reveal the secret work in case of a loss
- Stats page to keep track of number of games played, games won, current streak and max streak
- Guess distribution chart to visualize guess patterns
